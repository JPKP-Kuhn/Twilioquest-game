made by Twilio.
The version 3.12.2 of the game cannot be download anymore. So you just go in the
option **More >** and select the version 3.12.2

The TwilioQuest program was impacted by the recent organizational re-structure at Twilio.
The video game is being open sourced,
and will live on in a new home as TerminalQuest.

# To execute the game:
At Terminal type
